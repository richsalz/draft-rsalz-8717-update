          Update to RFC 8717: IETF Administrative Terminology
                     draft-rsalz-8717-update-latest

Abstract

   RFC 8717 updated several RFCs pertaining to the organization of the
   IETF to use the term "Managing Director, IETF Secretariat" (MDS).  As
   that term does not accurately reflect the organization or roles of
   the IETF staff, the MDS term is no longer relevant.  This document
   removes mention of particular staff roles, and instead updates the
   source documents so that the job to be done, and who the responsible
   entity is, are described.

   This note is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8717] updated several RFCs pertaining to the organization of the
   IETF to use the term "Managing Director, IETF Secretariat" (MDS).  As
   that term does not accurately reflect the organization or roles of
   the IETF staff, the MDS term is no longer relevant.  This document
   removes mention of particular staff roles, and instead updates the
   source documents so that the job to done, and who the responsible
   entity is, are described.

   This document updates [RFC3710] and [RFC6702].  It also changes the
   status of [RFC3929] and [RFC4633] to Historic.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Updates Being Made

   [RFC8717], Section 2 explained that [RFC2606] did not need to be
   updated because [RFC8179] removed the need for it.  While the same
   section of RFC 8717 provided an update to [RFC2028], that has
   similarly been overtaken by events in that it was obsoleted by
   [RFC9281], and Section 3 of RFC 9281 does not need revising.

   Further, the IETF is in the "consideration" stage of forming a
   working group to update [RFC2418]; for discussion, see the mailing
   list (https://mailman3.ietf.org/mailman3/lists/procon.ietf.org/).  An
   online document proposing changes to RFC 2418 to comply with this
   document (https://github.com/richsalz/draft-rsalz-2418bis/pull/14)
   are available.

   The following sub-sections make the specific changes for each RFC and
   therefore this document completely replaces Section 2 of RFC 8717.

3.1.  Changes to RFC 3710

   [RFC3710], Section 2 describes the composition of the IESG and
   mentions the IETF Executive Director twice.

   The first mention:

   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) Chair and the IETF Executive
   Director, as ex-officio members of the IESG.

   Is replaced with the following text:

   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) Chair and the IETF Executive
   Director or their designee, as ex-officio members of the IESG.

   The second mention:

   The IETF Executive Director is the person charged with running the
   IETF Secretariat.

   is deleted.

3.2.  Changes to RFC 3929

   [RFC3929] is an Experimental RFC published in 2004.  This document
   changes its status to Historic.

3.3.  Changes to RFC 4633

   [RFC4633] is an Experimental RFC published in 2006.  This document
   changes its status to Historic.

3.4.  Changes to RFC 6702

   [RFC6702], Section 5 says that WG Chairs and Area Directors are
   encouraged to ask the IETF Executive Directory to contact those who
   submitted an early intellectual property disclosure and request an
   update.  This document specifies an email address to be used for that
   purpose:

   To help prevent early IPR disclosures from becoming stale
   or incomplete, at important junctures in the standardization process
   (e.g., at working group adoption, before Working Group Last Call, and
   before IETF Last Call) WG chairs and ADs are encouraged to request
   that the Executive Director of the IETF contact those who submitted
   early IPR disclosures about updating their disclosures by
   sending email to XXX@ietf.org.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document has no security considerations.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
