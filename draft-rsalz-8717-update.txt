                     draft-rsalz-8717-update-latest

Abstract

   RFC 8717 updated several RFCs pertaining to the organization of the
   IETF to use the term "Managing Director, IETF Secretariat" (MDS).  As
   that term does not accurately reflect the organization or roles of
   the IETF staff, the MDS term is no longer relevant.  This document
   removes mention of particular staff roles, and instead updates the
   source documents so that the job to done, and who the responsible
   entity is (generally, the IETF LLC) are described.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8717] updated several RFCs pertaining to the organization of the
   IETF to use the term "Managing Director, IETF Secretariat" (MDS).  As
   that term does not accurately reflect the organization or roles of
   the IETF staff, the MDS term is no longer relevant.  This document
   removes mention of particular staff roles, and instead updates the
   source documents so that the job to done, and who the responsible
   entity is (generally, the IETF LLC) are described.

   This document updates [RFC3710], [RFC3929], [RFC4633], and [RFC6702].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Updates Being Made

   [RFC8717], Section 2 explained that [RFC2606] did not need to be
   updated because [RFC8179] removed the need for it.  While the same
   section of RFC 8717 provided an update to [RFC2028], that has
   similarly been overtaken by events in that it was obsoleted by
   [RFC9281], and Section 3 of RFC 9281 does not need revising.

   Further, the IETF is in the "consideration" stage of forming a
   working group to update [RFC2418]; for discussion, see the mailing
   list (https://mailman3.ietf.org/mailman3/lists/procon.ietf.org/).  An
   online document proposing changes to RFC 2418 to comply with this
   document (https://github.com/richsalz/draft-rsalz-2418bis/pull/14)
   are available.

   The following sub-sections make the specific changes for each RFC and
   therefore this document completely replaces Section 2 of RFC 8717.

3.1.  Changes to RFC 3710

   [RFC3710], Section 2 describes the composition of the IESG.  This
   section is updated to replace the original text that twice mentions
   "IETF Executive Director" with "a member of the IETF staff as
   specified by the IETF LLC."

3.2.  Changes to RFC 3929

   RFC 3929, an Experimental RFC, proposes a number of methods to
   resolve a deadlock when an IETF Working Group is unable to come to a
   decision.

   [RFC3929], Section 4.1.1 says that volunteers should send their names
   to the IETF Executive Directory, who should use [RFC3797] to choose
   if their is an excess of volunteers.  As the IESG is responsible for
   the standards process, this task should be fulfilled by someone they
   announce.

   Similarly, in [RFC3929], Section 4.3 an alternate method is
   described.  Again, the text is changed so that the IESG announces who
   will perform that task.

3.3.  Changes to RFC 4633

   [RFC4633], Section 1 says that the IETF Executive Director is
   empowered to restrict posting to the IETF discussion list
   (mailto:ietf@ietf.org).

   This document updates RFC 4633 to remove that ability.

3.4.  Changes to RFC 6702

   [RFC6702], Section 5 says that WG Chairs and Area Directors are
   encouraged to ask the IETF Executive Directory to contact those who
   submitted an early intellectual property disclosure and request an
   update.

   This document updates RFC 6702 to say that the IETF LLC, or their
   designee, should be contacted.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document has no security considerations.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
