From Jay:

It's basically section 2 of RFC 8717 that needs to be replaced so that the term "Managing Director, IETF Secretariat" (MDS) goes away as this no longer has any relevance and I don't think this can be left to rewrites of the individual documents.

Most of the current occurrences need to be rewritten so that they don't list
who does it, it is just done.

 2. Where Appropriate, Replacement of the IETF Executive Director Position
 with the Managing Director, IETF Secretariat

Under the IASA 2.0 structure, most of the responsibilities of the former
position of IETF Executive Director have been assigned to a new position (or
at least title) of Managing Director, IETF Secretariat. An "Executive
Director" title is now associated with different, and largely new,
responsibilities as an officer of the IETF Administration LLC. These changes
are covered in the description of the new structural arrangements [RFC8711].

This document applies that change to the following:

- RFC 9281, "The Organizations Involved in the IETF Standards Process",
[RFC2028], Section 3.3.

- RFC 2418, "IETF Working Group Guidelines and Procedures", [RFC2418],
Section 1.

- RFC 3710, "An IESG Charter", [RFC3710], Section 2.

- RFC 3929, "Alternative Decision Making Processes for Consensus-Blocked
Decisions in the IETF", [RFC3929], Sections 4.1.1 and 4.3 (twice).

- RFC 4633, "Experiment in Long-Term Suspensions From Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF) Mailing Lists", [RFC4633], Section 1.

- RFC 6702, "Promoting Compliance with Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)
Disclosure Rules", [RFC6702], Section 5.

Note that the current description of the Internet Standards Process [RFC2026]
does not require an update by this document for this purpose because the
reference to the IETF Executive Director in RFC 2026 was replaced by a
document [RFC3979] that precedes the current effort, and that document was,
in turn, obsoleted by RFC 8179 [RFC8179].
